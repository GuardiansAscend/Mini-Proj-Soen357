                     <p class="about_text">The elderly can sometimes be disregarded by the rest of the population; due to the fact that they tend to be out of their working careers. 
                        We intend not to make that mistake, and gather as much information as possible from and about them to be able to make an informed decision on the type of application they would like to see. </p>
                     <h2 class="newsletter_taital">Governmment Study</h2>
                     <p class="about_text">An official government study has been done into the state of seniors amid their isolation and loneliness during the pandemic, 
                        and the results are no doubt of some concern. This study had been conducted under the support of the Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Committee of Quebec, 
                        and has been peer reviewed by multiple accredited Quebec researchers. Here are some of the major findings from this paper:</p>
                        <h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
                        <h3>-	19% of seniors say they lack companionship and feel isolated from others</h3>
                        <h3>-	24% of seniors would like to participate in more social activities</h3>
                        <h3>-	22% of seniors were not participating in any social or community activities</h3>
                        <h3>-	37% of individuals living alone report not having sufficient social support</h3>
                        <h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
                        <p class="about_text">This isolation was also documented to be having severely negative effects on the senior’s physical and mental health: 
                           these seniors were more likely to have health problems, a lesser well-being and a higher risk of mistreatment. 
                           They were also less likely to be able to adapt and pick up healthier lifestyles, and reported to be increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters as well
                            as having an increased mortality rate. So clearly, there is a big problem here.</p>
                        <p class="about_text">Thankfully the study resulted in a list of suggestions to potentially help these people out of their perilous situation. 
                           The most important thing here is to reach out the seniors, understand what their problems were, and give support where needed. 
                           The type of support needed was vast, ranging from identification aid, to actions that promote social connection between the elders and their community. 
                           However, we saw potential for our app to fit in the range of “Information” and “Support Services”. It is suggested in this study to:</p>
                        <h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
                        <h3>-	Increase phone services for technology use support</h3>
                        <h3>-	Increase the availability of phone lines or websites with information on services available for different needs</h3>
                        <h3>-	Provide seniors with straightforward, accurate, and complete information</h3>
                        <h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
                        <p>We plan to take these suggestions to heart in the construction and design of our application. The full study can be found <a href="https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/files/publications/3033-social-isolation-loneliness-seniors-pandemic-covid19.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                        <h2 class="newsletter_taital">Interviews</h2>
                        <p class="about_text">We were able to meet with a few seniors that currently live in Quebec, and discuss their experiences of living through the isolation of
                           the pandemic and getting some insight into what types of services they would find helpful in such situations. They were made aware of the context of the interview,
                           the purpose of the research and related project before the start of the interview, and we assured them that their identities would remain anonymous even if perhaps
                           we would use their comments for the purpose of our research paper. When asked about the types of technical support they would have appreciated during their isolation,
                           here are a couple of excerpts from their answers:
                        </p>
                        <h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
                        <h3>
                           "For sure, I definitely would have liked more help with online stuff while we were all stuck inside. As you know, I already wasn't the most technical guru
                           before the pandemic started, but we went so much more online for everything after we were forced to stay inside. Not having someone available to help
                           me was the cause of a lot of frustrations for me, I can tell you that much."
                        </h3>
                        <h3>
                           "What bothers me most is having to look in so many places to find what I want. Its already enough having to manage my emails, and then my banking [...]
                           and everything else we have to do online, but now to also have to do meetings online? And look at calendars? [...] I just wish that it was all more manageable,
                           but now I just try to avoid going on the computer so I can keep my piece of mind."
                        </h3>
                        <h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
                        <p>
                           We value the interviews we have had with these seniors, and are going to attempt to design an application that will alleviate their frustrations.

                     <p class="about_text">Storward is an application which takes features that the elderly can benefit from and puts them in one platform.
                        The name Storward is derived from two acronyms. One which is ‘store’ and the other being ‘steward’. 
                        The ‘stor-’ acronym is used as the application is a platform where a user can store all kinds of information such as diaries, notes, passwords, medications, etc. 
                        The -ward acronym from ‘steward’ means that the application is steward of the users data, meaning their data will be kept secured, accessible and trusted.</p>
                     <p class="about_text">On our app, users will be able to store all sorts of information that they need to keep their lives organized and in check. They can write
                        notes, make diary entries, store their passwords, save pictures and even set up a calendar with various appointments and events they want to keep track of. The goal
                        is to allow these users to access as much of their commonly used information as possible in one place, so that they would be able to go to one place for everything
                        and make things easier in their day to day lives.
